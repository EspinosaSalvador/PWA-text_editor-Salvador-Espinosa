## Introduction

So, as part of our course, we created this awesome web application called a Progressive Web App (PWA). It's a text editor that runs right in your browser, and it's super cool because it incorporates all the concepts we learned during the course.

First of all, this text editor is a single-page application, which means it doesn't require multiple page reloads. It's all smooth and seamless, just like the apps you use on your phone. And the best part is that it meets the criteria of a Progressive Web App, which means it can work even when you're offline. So, you don't have to worry about losing your work if you suddenly lose internet connection.

To handle the data retrieval and storage, we used a special package called "idb." It's a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API and is widely used by big companies like Google and Mozilla. This package made it easier for us to work with the database and ensured that our text editor performs well and efficiently.
